gwt-spring-bootstrap
====================

A Gwt/Spring/Gradle application that can be used to bootstrap a web application

Not very generic at this point :)

Todo
====
- Add gwtsecurity + spring security
- Add @Secured examples
- Also need to do a TenantAwareFactoryBean, that creates instances based on different tenants
